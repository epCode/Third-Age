To add a schematic to a biome (e.g. a house).
Ensure that the table schems is being passed to the deco function.
	deco = function(data, p2data, vi, area, x, y, z, noise, noise2, schems)
Insert a table into schems:
	table.insert(schems, {"house.mts", {x = x, y = y-1, z = z}, {12, 10, "lottitems:dirt", "lottitems:dirt"}})

The format of the table inserted is as follows:
	{name of schem (in schems folder), 
	position (only the y value should need changing, to change where it appears),
	details for "filling in" under the schematic, so that it isn't floated, only needs to be present if this is desired.
		This has the following format:
			x length,
			z length,
			name of node that it should stop at (e.g. when it finds dirt),
			name of node to fill with.
